# [Syntax Tree Generator](https://dprebyl.github.io/syntree/)

This fork adds the following features over the [original version](https://github.com/mshang/syntree/) by mshang:

* Modern Bootstrap 4 design
* Two column layout allowing the full tree to be seen while editing
* Create higher resolution output images

The goal of this project is to create a browser-based, fully local syntax tree generator, for drawing trees as you might find in an introductory linguistics course. Here are a few main features:

* Designed to be easy to use.
* Draws as you type for real-time feedback.
* Basic support for movement arrows using markup.
* Supports Unicode insofar as the browser it is running on does.
* Adjustable appearance.
* Linkable, i.e. parses the query string.
