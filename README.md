# [Syntax Tree Generator](https://dprebyl.github.io/syntree/)

This fork adds the following features over the [original version](https://github.com/mshang/syntree/) by mshang:

* Modern Bootstrap 4 design
* Resizable two column layout allowing the full tree to be seen while editing
* Create higher resolution output images
* Indent lines with tab key for easier tree organization
* Key combos for special characters like silent heads
* Enhanced movement support allowing for chained movement (V moves to T moves to C)
* Automatically updating sharable URL
* Example trees from [The Science of Syntax](https://syntax.pressbooks.com/) by John Gluckman

The goal of this project is to create a browser-based, fully local syntax tree generator, for drawing trees as you might find in an introductory linguistics course. Here are a few main features:

* Designed to be easy to use.
* Draws as you type for real-time feedback.
* Basic support for movement arrows using markup.
* Supports Unicode insofar as the browser it is running on does.
* Adjustable appearance.
* Linkable, i.e. parses the query string.
